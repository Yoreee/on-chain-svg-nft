# Hardhat Project with on-chain svg metadata



This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.



### Include these in your .env:

``` RINKEBY_RPC_URL ```
* Get this from alchemy!

``` MNEMONIC ```
* Get this from metamask!

``` ETHERSCAN_API_KEY ```
* Get this from etherscan!


Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

### Some important commands:

* npx hardhat
* yard add [module name]
* hh deploy
* npx hardhat deploy --network [network]
* npx hardhat verify --network [network] [hash]


### Notes:

1. If SVG is not rendering, its probably an issue with the formatting of the SVG image.
